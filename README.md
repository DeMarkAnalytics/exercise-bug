# React & CSS Exercise

In this exercise we have a very simple price flasher. This price flasher should show a `flash` animation every time the value is updated. The compenent and css have been already started for you. However, there is a bug where the flash is only showing once. We would like you to fix this so the flash shows on every price update.


Files to use: 
`Flasher.js`
`Flasher.css`

The `Flasher` component will recieve a random price from a the `price-hook` if you would like to look at that code for more context. You should not expect the price to update on a regular period.
